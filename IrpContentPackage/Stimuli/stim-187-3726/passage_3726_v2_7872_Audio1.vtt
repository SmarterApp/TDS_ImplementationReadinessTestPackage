In the following presentation, you
will learn about archaeologists.

00:04.609 --> 00:08.359
Listen to the presentation and then
answer the questions that follow.

00:08.945 --> 00:12.188
Archaeologists are scientists
who study the objects--

00:12.213 --> 00:15.430
called artifacts--that
people have left behind,

00:15.455 --> 00:20.195
the sites where these are found, and the
landscapes in which the site existed.

00:20.508 --> 00:25.625
These artifacts give us clues about how
people lived their lives at earlier times.

00:25.959 --> 00:29.748
The artifacts may be scattered,
discovered one at a time.

00:29.773 --> 00:34.513
Or they may be together, in a place where
a village or settlement once stood.

00:34.982 --> 00:37.756
All of the information
archaeologists discover

00:37.781 --> 00:42.131
can be compared to the written history
and the oral history we know about.

00:42.638 --> 00:46.545
Sometimes archaeology confirms
the historical record.

00:46.959 --> 00:51.568
But sometimes what archaeologists
find raises new questions

00:51.593 --> 00:55.201
about the things we think we
know about people from the past.

00:55.670 --> 00:57.506
Regardless of what they find,

00:57.701 --> 01:02.428
archaeologists keep very careful records
of the site when a discovery is made,

01:02.662 --> 01:08.209
drawing or photographing artifacts in place
before removing them for further study.

01:08.873 --> 01:12.857
Just how do archaeologists decide where
to look for evidence of the past?

01:13.266 --> 01:18.422
Sometimes studying written and oral history
points them in the right direction.

01:18.773 --> 01:22.133
Other times they study
landforms in a certain region,

01:22.158 --> 01:26.820
looking for caves or hills where
artifacts may be hidden or buried.

01:27.094 --> 01:32.172
And sometimes, the discovery of a
ruin or tomb is a happy accident

01:32.367 --> 01:35.766
the result of digging a well
or building a shopping center!
