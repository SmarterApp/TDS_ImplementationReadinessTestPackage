One student said he learned about the importance of budgeting money. Another student reported that the class prompted her to open a Roth I.R.A. <br />-A study conducted by a professor at the University of Florida found that students who were required to take financial literacy classes in high school were more likely to budget and save their money, and less likely to accrue credit card debt.<br />Source #2 (Financial Education Leaving Americans Behind)<br />-There is evidence that financial literacy courses don't work and can potentially even harm the students who take them by making them overconfident in their ability to make good financial decisions.<br />-Willis says that financial literacy classes can actually keep people from attaining their financial literacy goals. She cites examples of students whose financial literacy skills stayed the same or decreased after taking financial literacy classes. <br />-A Harvard Business School study concluded that common financial literacy programs used in the past two decades did not alter the choices participants made about their finances.</p>]]></val>
