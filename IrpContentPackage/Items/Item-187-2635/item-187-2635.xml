            <samplecontent><![CDATA[<p style="">The table in Source #1 shows the amount of sleep that people of different age groups need every day to function well. This supports the claim in Source #2 that says everyone has an internal clock that follows day and night patterns. If your internal clock gets out of sync because of your habits, your sleep patterns will get messed up and you don't get the good night's sleep your body needs. In Source #3 a 12-year-old middle school student says she gets 8 hours of sleep a night and feels tired after school. Long naps just make her groggy. She writes to a doctor for advice about how to get more energy. The doctor tells her that a short nap might help, but she really needs to get more sleep at night. The table in Source #1 supports the doctor's advice. According to the table, a school-aged person should get 9-10 hours of sleep a day.</p>]]></samplecontent>
