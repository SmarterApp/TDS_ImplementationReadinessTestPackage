          <val><![CDATA[<p style="">Response is an evidence-based explanation that provides two pieces of evidence from different sources that support this claim and that explains how each example supports the claim. Student cites the source for each example.<br />Key Elements<br />1. Source #1:<br />-If you routinely lose sleep or choose to sleep less than needed, the sleep loss adds up. The total sleep lost is called your "sleep debt." You can't make up your sleep deficiency.<br />-Some people sleep more on their days off than on work days. This might upset their body's sleep-wake rhythm.<br />-Sleeping when your body is ready to sleep is important. Even if you sleep the number of hours recommended for your age group but you have interruptions to your sleep, your body can be affected.<br />2. Source #2:<br />-If a person's job causes their sleep to be interrupted, the internal clock can become confused. Then the person has trouble getting enough sleep.<br />-Astronauts who averaged two hours less sleep than usual when in space became grumpy and had trouble concentrating.<br />-Doctors in training and emergency-room doctors who work long hours have trouble sleeping enough. Studies showed that even having a short nap improved their mental performance. They made fewer mistakes when they weren't so tired.<br />3. Source #3:<br />-On nights when you don't get enough sleep, a short nap can recharge your body and increase mental alertness.</p>]]></val>

            <samplecontent><![CDATA[<p style="">People whose sleep is routinely interrupted might need to pay special attention to their sleep needs. According to Source #1, everyone needs a certain amount of sleep and that you need to sleep when your body is ready to sleep. If you don't get your required amount of sleep each night, you will experience "sleep debt" which can't be made up. Source #2 describes problems people might have when they don't get regular amounts of sleep. They discovered that astronauts in space who lost sleep got more grumpy and concentrated less. Doctors in training and people who work in emergency rooms often don't get regular sleep. They found that when they took naps to help catch up on sleep, they made fewer mistakes. So, it is important to get regular sleep, but if your sleep is interrupted, you might need to take a nap to help your body catch up.</p>]]></samplecontent>
