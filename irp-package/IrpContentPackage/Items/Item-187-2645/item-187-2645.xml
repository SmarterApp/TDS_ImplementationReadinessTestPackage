Being in space also changes how blood flows in the body.<br />-Their faces get puffy and their necks get bigger.<br />-At the same time, less blood flows to their legs, making them skinny. They call this condition "bird legs."<br />-The heart does not have to work as hard to pump blood in space. A muscle that does not work hard gets weaker and smaller.<br />-Astronauts' other muscles and their bones can get weaker, too.<br />-Astronauts have to do exercises when they are in space.<br />-It takes time for them to get back their Earth legs and learn how to live with gravity again</p>]]></val>

Astronauts have to do many different things in order to keep themselves healthy. Source #1 says that astronauts must be healthy and eat right. This is important because if they do not stay healthy and eat right, they will not be able to correctly do their job. They can do this by exercising and by being in good shape. Source #2 says that being in space changes how blood flows in the body. Astronauts' faces can get puffy and their necks can get bigger. This is hard on an astronaut because it changes their body.
