The following presentation
is from Faces magazine.

00:04.714 --> 00:09.662
In this piece, Christine Graf
writes about The Carter Center.

00:10.312 --> 00:17.552
When Jimmy Carter left the oval office in 1981
after serving as our country's 39th president,

00:17.604 --> 00:21.562
his career as a public
servant was far from over.

00:21.875 --> 00:26.354
In fact, some would say that his
best years were yet to come.

00:26.505 --> 00:30.229
Within one year of
returning home to Georgia,

00:30.333 --> 00:34.864
Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, founded
The Carter Center in Atlanta.

00:35.199 --> 00:42.036
It is a privately funded, nonprofit organization
that works in partnership with Emory University

00:42.061 --> 00:46.930
to promote democracy and improve health
and human rights around the world.

00:47.190 --> 00:50.601
They have helped people
in more than 70 countries

00:50.704 --> 00:56.329
people whom the Center describes as
being "the poor and often forgotten."

00:57.264 --> 00:59.582
Through its democracy program,

00:59.656 --> 01:03.354
The Carter Center has observed
elections around the world

01:03.379 --> 01:08.015
and helped develop international
standards for democratic elections.

01:08.091 --> 01:14.992
Its representatives go to countries where elections are
being held under troubled or dangerous conditions.

01:15.302 --> 01:19.469
The Carter Center does not represent
the United States government.

01:19.701 --> 01:26.810
Many of these countries are emerging from civil war or
armed conflicts and are transitioning to democracies.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.823
Election monitoring teams go only to countries
where high-level officials have invited them

01:33.901 --> 01:36.948
and where all political
parties will welcome them.
