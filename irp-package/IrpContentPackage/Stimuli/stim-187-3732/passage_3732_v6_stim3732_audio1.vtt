The following presentation
is from Northern Lights.

00:04.609 --> 00:09.141
In this piece, the author
discusses the Aurora Borealis,

00:09.297 --> 00:13.477
natural lights found in the
sky near the North Pole.

00:14.609 --> 00:18.242
The night sky above us is full of lights.

00:18.633 --> 00:23.477
These lights are stars and
planets far away in space.

00:24.053 --> 00:27.568
Most are bigger than planet Earth,
 where we live.

00:27.959 --> 00:31.709
They seem tiny because
they are so far away.

00:32.334 --> 00:37.686
In some places on Earth, people see
more than stars and planets in the sky.

00:38.310 --> 00:42.490
They see amazing lights
called the Northern Lights.

00:43.349 --> 00:48.154
The Northern Lights are the most
exciting light show you could ever see.

00:48.537 --> 00:52.326
They can start with a pale
green light in the sky.

00:52.873 --> 00:59.357
Sometimes, they become beautiful, bright
sheets of light dancing across the night sky.

00:59.982 --> 01:02.912
The Northern Lights are called an aurora.

01:03.420 --> 01:07.404
Their full name is the aurora borealis.

01:08.060 --> 01:13.490
The Northern Lights are most often seen
in places close to the North Pole.

01:13.998 --> 01:19.232
Sometimes people in Canada and Alaska
can see the Northern Lights, too.

01:20.092 --> 01:23.568
The Northern Lights form
high above the ground.

01:24.154 --> 01:27.279
They are usually around 60 miles

01:27.670 --> 01:31.459
(100 kilometers) up in
the Earth’s atmosphere.

01:32.344 --> 01:35.547
There are also lights
around the South Pole.

01:36.172 --> 01:40.859
The South Pole is on the frozen
continent of Antarctica.

01:41.211 --> 01:44.414
This is one of the coldest places on Earth.
